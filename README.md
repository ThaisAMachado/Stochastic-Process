# Stochastic Processes
This project has some scripts I developed while studying stochastic processes.

## Poisson-Process.R
This script has the R code implementation for a simulation of a Poisson process and some variants of it.

## processos-markovianos-de-saltos.R
This script has the R code implementation for a markov process composed by two markov processes, as described below (pt-BR).
